# Lip Reading Model

This repository contains a Lip Reading model based on the LipNet architecture. The model is designed to predict the spoken words from video frames of a speaker's lips.

## Overview

Lip reading, also known as visual speech recognition, is the process of interpreting speech by observing the movements of the lips, face, and tongue. This project implements a model that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to perform lip reading.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture is inspired by the LipNet paper and includes the following layers:

- 3D Convolutional layers
- Max Pooling layers
- TimeDistributed Flatten layer
- Bidirectional LSTM layers
- Dense layer with softmax activation

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of video frames with corresponding text labels. The input shape for the model is `(75, 46, 140, 1)` which corresponds to a sequence of 75 grayscale frames of size 46x140.

## Training

The model is trained using the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function, which is suitable for sequence-to-sequence tasks where the alignment between input and output sequences is unknown.

## Requirements

- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- ImageIO
- gdown

## Usage

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LipNet.git
cd LipNet
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download the dataset and prepare the data

Ensure you have the video files and alignment files as required. You can refer to the original LipNet repository for dataset preparation instructions.

### 4. Train the model

Run the Jupyter notebook `Lip_Read_model.ipynb` to train the model.

### 5. Evaluate the model

After training, you can evaluate the model on a test dataset. The notebook includes code to make predictions and visualize the results.
